                This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of this app
                 Services. By using the Indusface Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" 
                (which means that you simply browse or use the Site, including through a mobile device, or otherwise use the 
                Indusface Services without being registered) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered with Indusface).  
                The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are only authorized to access this Site or to use the Indusface
                Services, including materials and services contained in the Site (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) 
                if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and the terms of this Agreement.  Please read this Agreement carefully and save it.  
                If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to follow all applicable laws, you should leave the Site and discontinue use 
                of the Indusface Services immediately.  If you wish to make use of the Indusface Services, read this Agreement and reaffirm 
                your acceptance during the registration process.
                </p>
                <p >
                This Agreement includes Indusface's policy for acceptable use of the Indusface Services and Content 
                (as defined in Section 6.1 below) posted on or through the Indusface Services and your rights, obligations 
                and restrictions regarding your use of the Indusface Services and Content posted on or through the Indusface 
                Services.  In order to participate in certain Indusface Services, you may be notified that you are required to 
                download software or content and/or agree to additional terms and conditions from Indusface.  Unless otherwise 
                provided by the additional terms and conditions applicable to the Indusface Services in which you choose to participate, 
                those additional terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement.  
                </p>
                <p >
                Indusface may modify or amend this Agreement without notice at any time and such modification will be effective 
                upon posting by Indusface on the Site.  Your continued use of the Indusface Services after Indusface posts a 
                revised Agreement signifies your acceptance of the revised Agreement.  It is therefore important that you review this 
                Agreement regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.
                </p>
                <p >
                Please choose carefully the information you post on or through the Indusface Services and that you make available 
                directly or indirectly to other Users.  Your Indusface profile and any Content that you upload to Indusface may 
                not include any form of Prohibited Content, as outlined in Section 8 below.  Despite this prohibition, information, 
                materials, products or services provided by other Indusface Users (for instance, in their profile or images/videos) 
                may, in whole or in part, be unauthorized, impermissible or otherwise violate this Agreement, and Indusface assumes 
                no responsibility or liability for this material.  
                </p>
                <p >
                Indusface reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any posting (including 
                images or videos) by you, or to deny, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Indusface 
                Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without liability.  
                Indusface expressly reserves the right to remove any or all of your images, videos, account and profile and/or to 
                deny, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Indusface Services if Indusface determines, 
                in its sole discretion, that you have violated this Agreement or pose a threat to Indusface and/or its Users.

                the Indusface Services is terminated, this Agreement will remain in effect in its entirety.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Password.</strong> When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to choose a password.  You are entirely 
                responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password.  You agree not to use the account, username, or password of

                your account.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Use by Users.</strong> The Indusface Services are for the personal use of Users and may be used for promotional 
                purposes as well, but direct commercial endeavors may only be used if they are specifically endorsed or authorized by Indusface.  
                Indusface reserves the right to remove commercial content in its sole discretion.  Illegal and/or unauthorized use of the Indusface 
                Services, including collecting usernames, user id numbers, and/or email addresses of Users by electronic or other means for the 
                purpose of sending unsolicited email or unauthorized framing of or linking to the Site, or employing third-party promotional sites 
                or software to promote profiles for money, is prohibited.  Commercial advertisements, affiliate links, and other forms of 
                unauthorized solicitation may be removed from images, videos and/or Member profiles without notice or explanation and may result 
                in termination of Membership privileges.  Indusface reserves the right to take appropriate legal action for any illegal or 
                unauthorized use of the Indusface Services.</p></li>

                        (collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the Indusface Services.  By displaying or publishing ("posting") 
                        any Content on or through the Indusface Services, you hereby grant to Indusface and other users a non-exclusive, fully 
                        paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, 
                        reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats 
                        through any media channels, except Content marked "private" will not be distributed outside the Indusface Services. 
                        Indusface and/or other Users may copy, print or display publicly available Content outside of the Indusface Services, 
                        including without limitation, via the Site or third party websites or applications (for example, services allowing Users 
                        to order prints of Content or t-shirts and similar items containing Content).  After you remove your Content from the 
                        Indusface Website we will cease distribution as soon as practicable, and at such time when distribution ceases, the 
                        license to such Content will terminate.  If after we have distributed your Content outside the Indusface Website you 
                        change the Contentâ€™s privacy setting to "private," we will cease any further distribution of such "private" Content outside 
                        the Indusface Website as soon as practicable.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted 
                        by you on or through the Indusface Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) 
                        the posting and use of your Content on or through the Indusface Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, 
                        copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person, and (iii) the posting of your Content 
                        on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party.  You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and 
                        any other monies owing any person by reason of Content you post on or through the Indusface Services.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indusface Services contain Content of Indusface 
                        ("Indusface Content").  Indusface Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and 
                        Indusface owns and retains all rights in the Indusface Content and the Indusface Services.  Indusface hereby grants you a 
                        limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Indusface Content (excluding any software code) solely 
                        for your personal use in connection with viewing the Site and using the Indusface Services.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indusface Services contain Content of Users and other Indusface 
                        licensors.  Except as provided within this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, 
                        perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the Indusface Services.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indusface performs technical functions necessary to offer the 
                        Indusface Services, including but not limited to transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the 
                        Indusface Services.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.6</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Site and other Indusface Services are normally available, 
                        there will be occasions when the Site or other Indusface Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, 
                        for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of Indusface. 
                        Also, although Indusface will normally only delete Content that violates this Agreement, Indusface reserves the right to delete 
                        any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be stored by Indusface in order to comply with certain legal 
                        obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Indusface encourages you to maintain your own backup 
                        of your Content. In other words, Indusface is not a backup service.  Indusface will not be liable to you for any modification, 
                        suspension, or discontinuation of the Indusface Services, or the loss of any Content.</p></li>

                        violate the rights of any person or entity, or harm or threaten the safety of any person or entity. Indusface assumes no 
                        responsibility for monitoring the Indusface Services for inappropriate Content or conduct.  However, on both free and PRO 
                        accounts, and regardless of whether the Content is public or private, Indusface may choose to monitor such Content at any time, 
                        in its sole discretion. If at any time Indusface chooses to monitor the Indusface Services, Indusface nonetheless assumes no 
                        responsibility for the Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no responsibility for the conduct 
                        of the User submitting any such Content.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>7.2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You are solely responsible for the Content that you post on or through
